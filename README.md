# SEECRS_README
This readme file is a brief explanation of the organizational structure of our Github organization

Welcome! This is the Github organization of the SEECRS (Soil and Ecosystem Ecology for Climate Resilient Systems) lab,  https://gutknechtlab.cfans.umn.edu/, PI Dr. Jessica Gutknecht, in the UMN Department of Soil, Water, and Climate. I'm a soil ecologist and climate change ecologist by training, with a big focus on agroecology and and other management implications of climate change. See the website for specific projects.

This Github organization was created mainly as a way for us to organize code for processing the raw data from various methods in the lab, including several 96-well plate assays, Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer, and other soil and water analyses. 

This site is very new (spring 2023) and is still under construction. Currently we are choosing to have smaller repositories organized by code and example data for each lab method. We may add in projects or repositories for the statistics associated with individual projects as well, check back here for updates on the organization (updated 4/18/2023)

See the https://github.com/SEECRSlab/start-here repository for resources on getting started with git and github.
